SKCraft Launcher
================

This project provides an open-source Minecraft launcher platform for downloading, installing, and updating modpacks.

The launcher has its roots in MC Alpha as a launcher for sk89q's server.

**Note:** There are two names to the launcher:

* "SKMCLauncher" is the *older* version of this launcher. It is a more generic all-purpose launcher. It is no longer supported.
* This project is called "SKCraft Launcher." It is supported and in active use.

## Features

### For the modpack creator:

* No config files (aside from two at the start) needed to make a modpack -- you just make a folder with the modpack's files and run the builder tool on it
* Supports putting default files (config files, etc.) that are not overridden on a future update
* Supports the removal of files (which, from the PoV of the modpack creator, just involves deleting the file from the folder)
* Supports "optional" files or file sets that can be toggled on or off by the user
* The same directory can be used to create both a client modpack and a server modpack simultaneously (with server-only or client-only files) so you don't need to maintain two separate copies of the same files

### Technical features:

* Fast parallel downloads
* Incremental updates (downloading only changed files)
* Can update from ANY previous version to the latest version
* Updates can be resumed if they've failed or have been cancelled
* Updates also resume from where they left off
* Static file structure so it can be placed on a CDN without modification
* Files are deduplicated (on the file host) so you only ever have ONE version of a file across all modpacks and all modpack versions
* Option for users to enter a special key in the options dialog that can be used to show additional modpacks (i.e. private ones for testing) -- this requires some server-side code
* Can be used with a continuous integration system so you can combine it with your favorite version control (i.e. Git, SVN) and automatically deploy a new modpack update on push/tag

### Client features:

* Multiple modpacks are supported
* Custom news page for showing custom information
* Multiple profile support
* Log messages dialog with upload log option
* Options to adjust memory settings and Java flags
* Everything happens in a background thread so the UI never freezes
* All tasks have cancel buttons and (reasonably accurate) progress dialogs if things take too long
* Self-update mechanism (however, this requires a separate bootstrapper project)
